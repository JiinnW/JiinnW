Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) 是因果推断里解决 randomness is violated 问题的 reweighting 方法；Importance Sampling (IS) 是统计计算里的 reweighting 方法。Philip 老师在课堂上说二者是同一个方法在不同的领域命名；我想在这里记录一下我的理解。

## Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)

In causal inference we want to estimate \\(ATE=\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)]-\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)]\\) based on observables \\(D_iY_i(1), (1-D_i)Y_i(0),X_i\\). For simplicity, we will only discuss the estimation of \\(\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)]\\) next. 

Because of conditional unconfoundedness,
$$
\mathbb{E}[DY(1)|X]=\mathbb{E}[D|X]\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|X].
$$
Thus 
$$
\mathbb{E}[Y(1)]=\mathbb{E}_X\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|X]=\mathbb{E}_X\left[\frac{\mathbb{E}[DY(1)|X]}{\mathbb{E}[D|X]}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{DY(1)}{\mathbb{E}[D|X]}\right].
$$
Hence we can construct a reasonable estimator for \\(\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)]\\),
$$\sum_{i}\frac{D_iY_i(1)}{e(X_i)},$$ 
which is a reweighting of observables \\(D_iY_i(1)\\). 

## Importance Sampling (IS)

In Monte Carlo simulation, we want to estimate \\(\mathbb{E}[\xi]\\) based on realizations of another random variable \\(\zeta\\). Since 
$$\mathbb{E}[\xi]=\mathbb{E}[\zeta f_\xi(\zeta)/f_\zeta(\zeta)],$$
then 
$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_i\frac{\zeta_i} {f_\zeta(\zeta_i)/f_\xi(\zeta_i)}$$ 
is a reasonable estimator of \\(\mathbb{E}[\xi]\\).

## Relation

Now we try to map the two concepts. We might regard \\(\xi\\) as \\(Y(1)\\) and \\(\zeta\\) as \\(DY(1)\\). However, the weight of IS can't match that of IPW because the former one is a function of \\(\zeta\\) while the latter one is not a function of \\(DY(1)\\).

Conclusion: the relation of the two methods is that they both reweight samples. However, the reweighting methods are different and no one is more general than another.
