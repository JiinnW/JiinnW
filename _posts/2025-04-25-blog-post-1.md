避免被老师卷 To avoid being criticized by professor


## Mathematical Formulae
- paranthess: no need to use `\left( \right)` that adjust high of paranthess automatically, but should try `\big \Big \bigg \Bigg` to adjust mannually: \\(  (, \big(, \Big(, \bigg(, \Bigg( \\)
- space: `\, \; \quad \qquad`, e.g., `\min_{x} \; \max_{y} \; E[xxx]`: \\( 1\, 2\; 3\quad 4\qquad 5 \\)
- between lines of equation, may add `[5mm]` or `[3mm]` to look pretty
- `\rm` in text subscript
- `\mathbf{A}` for matrix, `\bm a` for vector, `\tilde \xi` for random variable, `\bmt \gamma` for random vector
- vector zero is `\bm 0`

## Assumption
- We further introduce the following notations to facilitate our analysis and presentation
- xxx, that is, (math formula)
- xxx, given by

## Theorem
- `\hfill \halmos` at the end of proof
- `\sc` in theorem title
- `\Cref` is useful; if don't use Cref, link Theorem and label with `~`, e.g., `Assumptions~\ref{asm1} and~\ref{asm2}`; `equation~\eqref{eq}`
- 相似的内容(定理、定义...)要对称
- , concluding the proof
- The proof is now complete.

## Citation
- What if the citation hasn't been published? 
```Latex
@article{xxx,
  title={Title.},
  author={姓1, 名1 and 姓2, 名2 and 姓3, 名3},
    year={2025},
pages={Available at SSRN}
}
```
  Tricks: 
  - Title ends with dot `.`
  - Fill pages with SSRN/arxiv

## Expression
- However v.s. nevertheless
- The key lies in figuring out is more academic than the key is to figuring out
- explore -> investigate
- are as follows -> are listed below
- Next we will investigate xxx. To this end, xxx / The key lies in figuring out xxx
- 从句 that 不省略 (notice, recall, ensure)，且比`which` formal
- the case `where`
- Hence, thus, consequently

## Common Mistakes
- One common mistake in LaTeX is using deprecated **LaTeX2.09** font commands (e.g., `\bf, \it, \rm, \sf, \tt`) instead of the modern LaTeX2e commands (e.g., `\textbf{}` or `\bfseries, \textit{}` or `\itshape`)
