避免被老师卷 To avoid being criticized by professor

- `\Cref` is useful; if don't use Cref, link Theorem and label with `~`, e.g., `Assumptions~\ref{asm1} and~\ref{asm2}`; `equation~\eqref{eq}`
- `\rm` in text subscript
- between lines of equation, may add `[5mm]` or `[3mm]` to look pretty
- `\hfill \halmos` at the end of proof
- `\sc` in theorem title
- vector zero is `\bm 0`
- `\, \; \quad \qquad`, e.g., `\min_{x} \; \max_{y} \; E[xxx]`
- What if the citation hasn't been published? 
```Latex
@article{xxx,
  title={Title.},
  author={姓1, 名1 and 姓2, 名2 and 姓3, 名3},
    year={2025},
pages={Available at SSRN}
}
```
  Tricks: 
  - Title ends with dot `.`
  - Fill pages with SSRN/arxiv
