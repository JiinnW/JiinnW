避免被老师卷 To avoid being criticized by professor

- `\Cref` is useful; if don't use Cref, link Theorem and label with ~, e.g., Assumptions~\ref{asm1} and~\ref{asm2}; equation~\eqref{eq}
- \rm in text subscript
- between lines of equation, may add [5mm] or [3mm] to look pretty
- \hfill \halmos at the end of proof
- \sc in theorem title
- vector zero is \bm 0
- \, \; \quad \qquad, e.g., \min_{x} \; \max_{y} \; E[xxx]
- Whatif the citation hasn't been published?
