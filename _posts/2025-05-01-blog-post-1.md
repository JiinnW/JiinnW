# 章节概述

## Part 1: Models

### 1 Introduction and Examples

Shows the applications of SP in different areas, in different forms.

\\( Q(x,\xi) = \min\\{ q^\top y \mid Wy = h - T x , y \geq 0 \\} \\)

- Farming example: decide the distribution of acres -> random yield is realized -> decide the amount to purchase; random technology matrix;
- Financial planning: make investment -> random return -> make investment -> ...; random technology matrix & multi-stage
- Electricity capacity: random demand; random RHS & multi-stage 具体不懂
- Manufacturing Quality: 
- Routing: random demand; random RHS



### 2 Uncertainty and Modeling Issues

介绍SP的框架，从概率论基础到SP的基本概念（recourse, risk）。此外，
- 2.6: Implicit representation of the second stage

## Part 2: Basic Properties

## 4 The Value of Information and the Stochastic Solution

Quantities of interest:
- RP (recourse problem): optimal SP solution
- WS (wait-and-see): prophet solution
- EEV (expectation of the expected value)
- EVPI (expected value of perfect information) = RP - WS 
- VSS (value of stochastic solution) = EEV - RP

## Part 3: Solution Methods

Solving methods:
- L-shaped method: 2-stage problems
- MC
